5)Virtual Environment Setup.Explain the concept of a virtual environmentin Python. Why is it important, especially in data science projects? Create a virtual environment named "ml_env" using the venv module (for Python 3.3 and later). Activate the virtual environment and install a Python library of your choice (e.g., NumPy) within this environment. Write a Python script that imports the library and performs a basic operation (e.g., creating an array or matrix).

## Virtual Environment in Python

### Concept
A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment that allows you to manage dependencies separately for different projects.

### Importance
- **Dependency Management:** Avoids conflicts between project dependencies.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent development and deployment environments.
- **Isolation:** Keeps project-specific libraries separate from global installations.

### Setup

1. **Create Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ml_env
   ```

2. **Activate Virtual Environment:**
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     ml_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     source ml_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Library (NumPy):**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

4. **Python Script (example.py):**
   ```python
   import numpy as np

   array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
   print(array)
   ```

5. **Run Script:**
   ```bash
   python example.py
   ```

### Conclusion
Virtual environments ensure isolated and manageable project dependencies, crucial for consistent and conflict-free data science projects.
